Library contains only three classes:

- `DXTableViewModel` - implements delegate and data source methods of table view.
- `DXTableViewSection` - represents table view's section.
- `DXTableViewRow` - represents table view's row.

## Key Features

Library was designed to fit following needs:

 - To be simple: only three classes with intuitive relationships between them.
 - To minimize the need to learn new stuff by providing block-based API with
similiar to delegate and data source naming.
 - To be easy to integrate into existing projects by avoiding custom cells and
 view controllers classes.
 - To provide simple data binding capabilities and make it optional to use.
